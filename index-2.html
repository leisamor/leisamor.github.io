          I met Leis a couple years ago. She introduced me to cannabis and its potential for my conditions.  She helped me get my medical marijuana card and took me to my first dispensary.  Leis is a great coach and I trust her completely.  I'm mostly take CBD for my pain and I increased my dose to 1000 mg per month.  I've found that my desire for sweets has diminished.  I've lost almost 12 pounds over the last couple months.  I still like sweets though, but can do without.  I've tried edibles and a lot of things over the year. But, the CBD works the best for the pain in my face.

          My dog Siberian Husky Kodi is special and was born with a short straw.  He has seizures, low thyroid, chronic peripheral neuropathy in addition to mild hip dysplasia.  He suffers from chronic pain.  After his first big seizure and seeing the neurologist, she diagnosed him with epilepsy and stated he would have a seizure every month at minimum.  We had had him on CBD for pain but at this time increased it.  That was about 8 months ago and he has had one small seizure since, on a day when we forgot his CBD dose.  We truly feel CBD has improved his quality of life and allowed him to be a more normal dog.  We are very grateful to Leis for helping us understand he right dose for him and how to use it.

          I have spent the last year working with Leis to guide me through the process of understanding and buying my medication.  I think one of the most important things I have learned is to listen to my body.  As I have accepted my diagnosis of stage 4 cirrosis of the liver (non alcoholic), Leis and I are working to extend my life and quite frankly I would not have lasted this long without her help.  My liver enzymes have gone from 300 to 98 so I am improving and controlling my pain .   Thank you Leis for everything.

          Finding out that my 75-year-old mother has stomach cancer in July 2018 was one of the worst things that ever happened to our family.  Immediately we did research to see what other than the normal chemo therapy would be available to fight this horrible disease.  What kept coming up was the Rick Simpson Cannabis Oil with THC.  I believed that medical marijuana could help people with medical conditions but had no idea it would be a cancer fighter.  We turned to Leisa for guidance and education as this was an unknown area to us.  What we learned through consultation and coaching that there are so many different levels of use and everyone needs to find out what’s best for them and what their body can tolerate.  My mom has used the Rick Simpson Oil faithfully as well as the traditional chemo therapy that was tolerated and today is cancer free.  She will continue to use it to maintain the fight.  She even uses edibles to help with appetite.  As a result of the education process with Leisa, I learned that CBD Oil without THC can be used to heal minor injuries and body aches.  I use this for my children as they are very active with tackle football and this has been a great addition to the healing process.   I would highly recommend hiring Leisa through consultation and coaching to help anyone through there healing process.
